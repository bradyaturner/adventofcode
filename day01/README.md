DAY ONE, PART ONE

The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input)
and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The
list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in
the list.

DAY ONE, PART TWO

Now, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the
digit halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10
items, only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward
matches it. Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.
